***************************** TASK 1- NUMBER GUESSING GAME *******************************************

 Here's how you can play the simplified number guessing game:

 1. Start the Game: Run the Java program. You'll see the welcome message and instructions.

 2. Guess the Number: The program will randomly select a number between 1 and 100. Your task is to guess this number.

 3. Enter Your Guess: The program will prompt you to enter your guess. Type in a number and press Enter.

 4. Receive Feedback: After each guess, the program will provide feedback: // - If your guess is correct, it will congratulate you and display the number of attempts it took. // - If your 
    guess is too low, it will tell you to try a higher number. // - If your guess is too high, it will tell you to try a lower number.

 5. Attempts Remaining: You have a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the correct number. The program will inform you of how many attempts you have left.

 6. Play Again: After each round, the program will ask if you want to play again. If you type "yes" (case-insensitive), it will generate a new random number, and you can play another round. 
    If you type anything else, the game will end.

 7. Score: The program keeps track of your score, which is the number of times you guessed the correct number. It will display your final score when you choose not to play again.

 8. Game Over: The game ends when you decide not to play another round. The program will display your final score, and you can close the program.

 This code represents a simplified ATM system where we can check your balance,  deposit money,  and withdraw money.  It's a program that should help you understand the basic structure of 
  such a particular ATM SYSTEM.

1. Create a class to represent the ATM machine.

2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
   checking the balance.

3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
   checkBalance().

   balance.

6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
